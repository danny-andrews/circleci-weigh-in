Expand test coverage.

Replace Promises with Flutures.

Use named parameters for error message sprintf.

Stats should passed around as a list, not an object. Currently, we have to do a
bunch of conversions back and forth (see bundle sizes from webpack stats).

Move ReaderPromise into seperate repo.

Give ReaderPromise an unwrap method, and use that instead of hijacking the
underlying Reader's run method.
